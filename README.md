# Python for Biologists ðŸ§¬
This repository contains my practice Python files from the Python for Biologists course at my university. These files demonstrate my progress and learning in using Python for biological data analysis. The code focuses on solving real-world problems in bioinformatics, genomics, and computational biology.

## Key Features ðŸ“š
**Basic Python Syntax:**  <br/> Includes exercises to solidify core Python concepts like variables, loops, and functions. <br /> <br/>
**Bioinformatics Applications:**<br /> Practical examples of using Python for sequence analysis, protein structure prediction, and biological data parsing. <br /><br />
**Python Libraries:**<br /> Practice with essential libraries such as BioPython, Pandas, and Matplotlib for handling and visualizing biological datasets. <br /> <br/>
